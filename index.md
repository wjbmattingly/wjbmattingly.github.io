Dr. William Mattingly is a 2022 Harry Frank Guggenheim Distinguished Scholar and a [2022-2023 ACLS Grantee](https://www.acls.org/fellow-grantees/william-mattingly/) for his work as co-principal investigator and lead developer for the *[Bitter Aloe Project](https://bitteraloeproject.createuky.net)* which examines testimonies of violence from South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. He is currently the [Postdoctoral Fellow for the Analysis of Historical Documents](https://datascience.si.edu/people/dr-william-mattingly) at the Smithsonian Institution's [Data Science Lab](https://datascience.si.edu/). Mattingly currently works on two projects at the Smithsonian. The first is based at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), where he is developing a robust pipeline of machine learning image classification and natural language processing (NLP) models to automate the cataloging of millions of images. At the Smithsonian, he is working on a project connected to the American Women's History Initiative. Here, he is developing machine learning and heuristic pipelines with spaCy, a Python NLP library. This pipeline will identify women in Smithsonian documents and automatically extract knowledge about them so that we can better understand the influential role women played at the Smithsonian.

During his time at the Smithsonian, he has authored five non-peer reviewed textbooks designed for humanists with no coding experience.

- *[Introduction to Python for Digital Humanities (2022)](https://python-textbook.pythonhumanities.com)*
- *[Introduction to BookNLP (2022)](https://booknlp.pythonhumanities.com)*
- *[Introduction to spaCy (2021)](https://spacy.pythonhumanities.com)*
- *[Introduction to Pandas (2021)](https://pandas.pythonhumanities.com)*
- *[Introduction to Named Entity Recognition (2020)](https://ner.pythonhumanities.com)*

These textbooks will be published as *Introduction to Python for Humanists* with Routledge in 2022 under the CRC Data Science, Stats, and Math series. These textbooks are designed to work alongside his on-going digital project, *[Python Tutorials for Digital Humanities](https://www.youtube.com/pythontutorialsfordigitalhumanities)*

Mattingly is a medievalist by training. He completed his Ph.D. in History at the University of Kentucky in May 2020. There, his research looked closely at Carolingian intellectual networks, Scriptural exegesis, Alcuin (d. 804), and the city of Tours, France. That research is the foundation for an on-going digital project, *[The Digital Alcuin Project](https:\\www.digitalalcuin.com)* which provides all of Alcuin's letters as raw text with metadata. The current app is in alpha-testing with much of the metadata requiring manual validation.
